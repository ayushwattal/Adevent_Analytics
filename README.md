1. Online advertising is also one of the top revenue streams in the world. To run such an advertising business, a system needs to be able to handle terabytes of data and process the same in a fraction of seconds. 
2. Providing real-time feedback to Advertising Servers and providing analytical reports periodically to Advertisers is a much-needed feature in the Advertising system. 
3. Our project focus will be to demonstrate the functionality of such an advertising system using data pipelines built on top of Google Cloud.
